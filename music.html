          <p>The favourite album of the month is "Special Forces" by Alice Cooper, released in 1981.</p>

          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>I never really was that in to Alice Cooper.  I liked a couple of his classics, but never really
              acquainted myself with his entire catalog.  After being pointed at a list of hard rock and heavy
              metal albums that turned 40 this year (yes, I'm old), "Special Forces" was on the list and has been
              such a gem.  Favourite songs are "Prettiest Cop on the Block", "Skeletons in the Closet" and
              "You're a Movie".
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>After hearing this album, I explored some other of Alice's past work, but nothing else has stuck quite
            like this one.  His style, generally, is not my favourite, but this album is an exception.  Fortunately
            the era of cassette tapes is over...if it wasn't, and I had this album on cassette tape, it would be
            worn out. :)
