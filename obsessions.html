      <h2>From one obsession to the next...</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Ever since I was young, I've tended to pursue my interests in waves that I'll call obsessions.  I go full bore on them until they peter out
        and the next one comes along.  I did it with stamp collecting and comic books in the 1980s.  The stamp one was kind of bad, as I remember getting
        into some sort of service which sent new stamps each week, and had a tight deadline to return them if you didn't want them, otherwise you had to pay.
        I remember my Dad having to step in and help me craft a letter to the company to get the service to stop. I think they eventually did but it took a 
        couple of tries.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Today the obsessions thing continues, my latest one being dusting off my coding skills. I'm an engineer, and I feel it's essential I known
        how to solve problems by writing a computer program to code the solution or build a website to convey knowlege.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>I'd like to try to provide information which allows you the reader to derive something of benefit from my obsessions. I'll likely use the
        blog I started over on Medium for this purpose.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Stay tuned!</p>
